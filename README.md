# CSharp_Minigames

Got an assignment at a technical interview to design a 4-in-a-row game. I didn't get to code all the details I wanted to and I hate leaving a thing half-done, so I'm gonna put it up here and work on it till it's playable. It's clearly not going to be a big project - even if I can think of a lot of improvements to make, it's a game that's been done a thousand times before. But maybe more small game implementations will follow.
